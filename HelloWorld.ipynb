    "### What is a Bell state circuit?\n",
    "\n",
    "A Bell state circuit is made up of two gates, the Hadamard gate and a CNOT gate, more on this laters. The combination of these two circuits allow you to investigate the Bell states. Essentially, the 4 states that are created when two qubits are entangled. \n",
    "\n",
    "*these are also known as EPR states*\n",
    "\n",
    "The four bell states:\n",
    "|β₀₀⟩ = (|00⟩ + |11⟩) / √2\n",
    "|β₀₁⟩ = (|01⟩ + |10⟩) / √2\n",
    "|β₁₀⟩ = (|00⟩ - |11⟩) / √2\n",
    "|β₁₁⟩ = (|01⟩ - |10⟩) / √2\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What this actually means\n",
    "\n",
    "The end states are denoted as |β₀₀⟩, |β₀₁⟩, |β₁₀⟩, |β₁₁⟩, also known as  Φ⁺, Φ⁻, Ψ⁺, Ψ⁻\n",
    "\n",
    "- |00⟩ = both qubits in state 0\n",
    "- |01⟩ = first qubit in state 0, second qubit in state 1  \n",
    "- |10⟩ = first qubit in state 1, second qubit in state 0\n",
    "- |11⟩ = both qubits in state 1\n",
    "\n",
    "*In dirac notion, the first number in the brackets is the first qubit, the second the second. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### The mathematics\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You start with the initial state of |00⟩\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Application of the Hadamard gate put it into a superposition of |0⟩ and |1⟩: (|00⟩ + |10⟩)/√2 \n",
    "\n",
    "3. CNOT gate then flips the second qubit, depending on the first: (|00⟩ + |11⟩)/√2 = |β₀₀⟩. We can see that in the first |00 becayse the first qubit is 0, the second doesnt flip, but then in the second because the first is 1, the second is now 1. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. The main point is that because the second qubit depends on the superposition of the first, this means the two qubits are entangled. If this doesn't immediately make sense, neither. But let's proceed forth in ignorance for now. Some understanding just takes time. \n",
