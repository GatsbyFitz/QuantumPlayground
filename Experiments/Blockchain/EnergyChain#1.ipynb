    "As I have discussed in the following article.... blockchain holds some promise as a technology that might be able to simplify the energy system through the creation of a simplified, decentralised trading mechanism that isn't subject the whims of a centralised system operator such as AEMO. By leveraging distributed ledger technology, participants in the energy market could transact directly with one another, increasing transparency and reducing the need for intermediaries. This approach has the potential to streamline settlement processes, lower transaction costs, and empower both producers and consumers to manage energy flows more efficiently. Most importantly, I have a belief that it will lower energy costs, the #1 object of Australia's National Energy Objective.\n",

    "Who knows, I might be totally wrong. But in my mind, through appropriate incentivisation, this is the future. Regardless, it's going to be a fun experiment, so let's get into it. \n",

    "Funnily enough my thesis from business school was the application of blockchain in the pharmaceutical industry. I only got a 2:1 for my thesis, so it's time for some redemption!"

    "You can use frameworks such as hyperledger fabric, and blockchain-as-a-service such as IBM Blockchain. But for the sake of this proof of concept, let's get back to basics...using pure Python Code. This will give us the best idea of how blockchain fundamentally works."
