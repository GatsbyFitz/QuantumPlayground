    "# CHSH inequality\n",
    "\n",
    "Once again, as we continue our exploration of basic quantum computing experiments and practices, this time we tackle the CHSH inequality, following IBM's wonderful tutorial here: https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/docs/en/tutorials/chsh-inequality\n",
    "\n",
    "But I'll be diving a few layers deeper to provide a more balanced and simpler explanation of what the hell is going on?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is the CHSH inequality?\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, CHSH is simply the authors: Clauser, Horne, Shimony, and Holt. The CHSH inequality is a mathematical expression used to test whether the predictions of quantum mechanics:\n",
    "\n",
    "Which predicts that the CHSH inequality can be violated, with a maximum value of \n",
    "$$\n",
    "2\\sqrt{2} \\approx 2.828\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "It tests whether this can actually be explained by any local hidden variable theory, is so we shouldn't get a value larger than 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Local hidden variable theory is a classical idea that tries to explain quantum phenomena using two assumptions:\n",
    "- Locality: No information or influence travels faster than light. What happens to one particle cannot instantly affect another far away.\n",
    "- Realism: Particles have pre-existing properties (hidden variables) that determine the outcomes of measurements, even if we don’t know them.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this view, the strange correlations seen in quantum experiments are just the result of these hidden variables — not spooky action at a distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Bell's theorem\n",
    "\n",
    "Bell’s Theorem, formulated by physicist John Stewart Bell in 1964, addresses a fundamental question raised by Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen (EPR) in 1935: Is quantum mechanics a complete theory, or are there “hidden variables” that determine outcomes behind the scenes?\n",
    "\n",
    "Bell showed that if such hidden variables exist and if they obey locality (no faster-than-light influence), then the correlations between entangled particles must obey certain mathematical limits — now known as Bell inequalities.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### To summarise\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm not sure I fully understand this, but in essence we are looking to see whether we will get a value larger than 2 from this inequality. If that is the case, then nature does work quantum mechanically and cannot be explained by local variable hidden theory.\n",

    "## Step 1. Mapping the Problem, and creating the circuit\n",
    "\n",
    "To perform this experiment requires the entanglement of a pair of qubits on two different bases. The first qubit will have bases of A and a, and the second will have B and b.  This can be expressed as the **quantity**:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "S_1 = A(B - b) + a(B + b)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are the bases?\n",
    "\n",
    "The bases here refer to the different directions that you choose to measure the qubit. In this experiment, we measure one qubit in the Z and X bases,different also orthogonal angles $ \\theta $. Note we will sweep the angle between 0 and 2 $\\pi$ to show the inequality rising and falling above and below 2. Cool right?\n",
    "\n",
    "So if we know that the result of the measuring the observable must only be either 1 or -1 (since the measurement projects the qubit into one of two states either be up or down along that measurement axis). \n",
