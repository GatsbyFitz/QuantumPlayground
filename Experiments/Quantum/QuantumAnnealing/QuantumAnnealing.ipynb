    "So today is an exciting day, today we experiment with a different type of Quantum technology, Quantum Annealing. To date, we have been utilising IBM's gate-based quantum compute which allows for more general problem handling. While Quantum Annealing is an alternative approach that is very good at optimisation problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'll be following along to the tutorial that can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8BAPMYrw2aU&list=PLPvKnT7dgEsujrrP7i_mgbkivBN3J6A8u&index=6. But as usual, I'll be going rogue and exploring different tangents to try to make the tutorial more informative, and fundamentally, insightful. Rather than saying alot of things that are assumed as correct without going into the details of what it is. A favourite quote of mine that highlights the difference in knowing vs comprehension is: \"Any fool can know. The point is to understand.\"."

    "## What is Quantum Annealing?\n",
    "\n",
    "Finding the optimum solution to problems by searching over a space and finding the global minimum = the optimal solution to the problem. The benefit of Quantum vs Classical Computing is the ability to tunnel and skip to the next lowest point rather than having to explore every single step/part of the energy topology.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like before, we craft a Hamiltonian that encodes the optimisation problem, where we can input the state of the system (a configuration of qubits), and the energy value associated with that state is the output. \n",
    "\n",
    "📌 Analogy: Think of the Hamiltonian as a “terrain map” where each point (state) has a height (energy). By crafting the terrain carefully, you ensure that the lowest valley corresponds to the solution you want. The quantum system then “rolls downhill” to that valley."
